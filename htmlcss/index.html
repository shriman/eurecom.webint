				<h2>LINDSEY STIRLING</h2><br>
				<article>
				<p>
					Lindsey Stirling is one of the biggest artist development breakthrough stories in recent years. A classically trained violinist from Gilbert, AZ, Lindsey has entered a futurist world of electronic big beats and animation, leaping through the music industry with over 675 million views on YouTube, Billboard chart-topping hits and sold out tours worldwide.
Lindsey’s self-titled debut album featured twelve original tracks; including the viral smash “Crystallize,” which has racked up over 97 million YouTube views. The album has sold over 350,000 copies in the US without the backing of a major label, and has gone platinum in Germany and gold in Poland and Switzerland. The album reached number one on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Chart and the Billboard Classical Album Chart and also peaked at #22 on the Billboard Top 200.
